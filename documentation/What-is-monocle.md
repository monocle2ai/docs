# Monocle for tracing GenAI app code

Monocle is built for: 
- **app developers** to trace their app code in any environment without lots of custom code decoration 
- **platform engineers** to instrument apps in prod through wrapping instead of asking app devs to recode
- **GenAI component providers** to add observability features to their products 
- **enterprises** to consume traces from GenAI apps in their existing open-source observability stack

Benefits:
- Monocle provides an implementation + package, not just a spec 
   - No expertise in OpenTelemetry spec required
   - No bespoke implementation of that spec required
   - No last-mile GenAI domain specific code required to instrument your app
- Monocle provides consistency  
   - Connect traces across app code executions, model inference or data retrievals
   - No cleansing of telemetry data across GenAI component providers required
   - Works the same in personal lab dev or org cloud prod environments
   - Send traces to location that fits your scale, budget and observability stack
- Monocle is fully open source and community driven
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Implementation is transparent
   - You can freely use or customize it to fit your needs 

## What Monocle provides

- Easy to [use](#use-monocle) code instrumentation
- OpenTelemetry compatible format for [spans](src/monocle_apptrace/metamodel/spans/span_format.json). 
- Community-curated and extensible [metamodel](src/monocle_apptrace/metamodel/README.md) for consisent tracing of GenAI components. 
- Export to local and cloud storage
